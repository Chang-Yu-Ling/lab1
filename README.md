Lab 1_B

1. Set the input value as "n". The user is first prompted to enter an integer. After pressing "enter", the value is read in.

2. Substituting the input value into "for loop", the loop will repeatedly operate until the value exceeds the given condition.

3. Use "if else" in the for loop to detect  the "remainder"  of input number so as to distinguish between odd and even number. Then calculate separately to find new value of n.

4. Finally, through the "for loop", repeating the judgment and calculation of step3, a sepuence of values will be obtained until n equal 1.Print all value obtained ,and then the program ends execution.
